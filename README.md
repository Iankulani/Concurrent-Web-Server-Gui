# Concurrent-Web-Server-Gui
A simple concurrent web server. This project demonstrates the implementation of a Concurrent Web Server that can handle multiple client requests simultaneously. It uses multithreading to ensure that each client request is processed independently, allowing the server to efficiently handle numerous incoming connections without blocking.

Key Features.
Concurrency. The server can handle multiple client requests simultaneously using threads.

Scalability: Can handle a large number of clients concurrently, making it ideal for web applications with high traffic.

Simple HTTP Handling. The server processes basic HTTP requests and responds with static content.

Multithreading: Each client request is handled in a separate thread, ensuring non-blocking operations.

This repository serves as a basic foundation for creating a high-performance web server capable of handling multiple client requests concurrently, which is essential for building scalable and efficient web applications.
